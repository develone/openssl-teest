Named for John G. Nicolay, President Lincoln's personal secretary, this is considered the "first draft" of the 
speech, begun in Washington on White house stationery. The second page is writen on different paper stock, 
indicating it was finished in Gettysburg before the cemetery dedication began. Lincoln gave this draft 
to Nicolay, who went to Gettysburg with Lincoln and witnessed the speech. The Library of Congress owns this manuscript.

 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in 
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so 
dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We come to dedicate a portion of 
it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow, this ground The brave men, 
living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will 
little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.

It is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great task remaining before us that, from these 
honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of 
devotion that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth 
of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Extra arguments given.
